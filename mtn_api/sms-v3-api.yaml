          The keyword field is used in cases where the partner needs to share
          the short code and the partner had already subscribed with this
          keyword for Delivery Receipts via the subscriptions endpoint. The
          keyword field will then be used to send an outbound request to
          indicate that this request uses a shared short code and the Delivery
          receipt will be sent to the endpoint that was registered with this
          keyword . `Currently this is only used and was requested by the

          field is mandatory and if a senderAddress is used rather than the
          serviceCode , then the senderAddress value must be passed as well to
          this field,this will ensure that the messages are sent using the
          senderAddress.

          This is the MADAPI Canonical Error Code (it is 4 characters long and
          it is not the HTTP Status Code which is 3 characters long). Back-end
          system errors are mapped to specific canonical error codes which are
          returned. More information on these mappings can be found on the
          MADAPI Confluence Page 'Response Codes'
